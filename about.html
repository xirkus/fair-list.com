	<h3>Risk vs. Cost</h3>
	<h4>For Sellers</h4>
	<p>One of the most significant costs associated with selling your property as a homeowner is the commission paid to the agents who represent the buyer and yourself. Depending on where you live, the cost for using a traditional real estate agency is approximately 5% to a whopping 8% (if you live in a red-hot market) of the final sale price. This cost represents a substantial amount of money. The question that everyone should ask themselves however is - is it worth it?</strong></p>
                     
	<p>Looking at your home as an investment, you bare the sole responsibility for the risk of purchasing your property. Why then should an agent (or agents) be entitled to such a significant portion of your home's equity when it is sold?</p> 

	<p>As the property owner, <em>you</em> alone bare the cost of the transaction. Agents will argue that their services encompass knowledge such as expertise in the local market, and skill in negotiating, but in the digital world in which we live in, this is becoming less of an advantage. According to the National Association of Realtors (NAR), 54% of buyer found their properties on the internet. In addition, over 70% of buyers begin their search online before even contacting an agent.  Agents can coordinate all the moving parts, but, ultimately the responsibility for the most important aspects of the transaction belong to you. An agent’s emotional support may be valuable to some, but it comes at a premium.</p>

	<p>Instead, let us provide you with all the tools you need to successfully sell your property yourself, and save your hard-earned equity. You deserve it.</p>

	<h4>For Buyers</h4>
	<p>Technology has fundamentally changed how home buyers find the properties they’re interested in and yet, the real estate industry as a whole still believes in an antiquated view of the value they are providing to both buyers and sellers. If you’re lucky enough to live in areas where upstarts such as Redfin, Opendoor, or Purplebricks operate, then you may be able to save some money on the purchase of a new house. But if you're not, then the traditional agent/brokerage is the likely alternative.</p>

	<p>However, given their reliance on agents as the way to deliver their service, the cost associated with these services represents a significant premium. Given you will likely do a lot of the upfront legwork of identifying properties that meet your criteria, why pay the agent’s premium (which for buyers is approximately 3% of the final price or half the total commission on the final price)?</p>

	<p>If you were able to negotiate directly with a property owner, imagine being able to use that 3% to negotiate a better price. How much could you save on your mortgage? Would that be worth it to you?</p>
