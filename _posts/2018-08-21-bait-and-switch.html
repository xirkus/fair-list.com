description: How Zillow Uses FSBO as Lead Generation for Agents
comments: true
excerpt: |
  Zillow makes the majority of its money by providing advertising for agents. Approximately 90% of their revenue is
  associated with agent ads according to their quarterly financial reports. The Premier Agent™ program and
  Zillow's recent entry into the house flipping market with Zillow Offers™ only reinforce their
  agent-centric business model.

	<h3>It's All About the Agents</h3>

		You should keep this in mind when looking for, and listing FSBO properties on Zillow.
		While Zillow is a great resource for getting comprehensive information about listings and the local market,
		access to this information comes at a price.
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		<h4>The Real Cost</h4>
		<p>
			By Zillow's own account on FSBO listings, approximately <u>36% of sellers attempt to sell their homes</u>
			themselves. Only <u>11% are successful</u>. These numbers clearly show the desire in the marketplace for FSBO.
			Unfortunately, the system is designed to work against you. How does Zillow undermine FSBO?
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p>
					<strong>As a seller, <u>there is no way</u> to opt out of the Premier Agent Program.</strong>
					You can't even pay Zillow to do so.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					<strong>Conversely, as a buyer, Zillow's Premier Agent program will "suggest" agents or realtors
					who may not actually represent the seller.</strong> This is highly misleading and is designed to
					introduce a buyer's agent into the process.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					<strong>FSBO is completely missing from their mobile application.</strong> The mobile app is
					designed to funnel your listings to agents. There is no stronger indication of Zillow's priorities
					by completely excluding this feature from its applications.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					<strong>Zillow's only concern is for the agents.</strong> The only reason Zillow lists FSBO is to
					convert these leads to for sale by agent (FSBA). Still unsure?
					<a href="https://www.zillow.com/agent-resources/blog/why-does-zillow-display-fsbo/">
						Checkout this article for their Premier Agent program regarding FSBO listings.</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					There's even a term in the industry for this type of lead generation - "prospecting". When an
					agent asks to "preview" your property, what they're doing is pretending to have an interested
					buyer when all they want is to convert your listing to FSBA.
				</p>
			</li>
		</ul>

	<h3>Caveat Emptor</h3>
	<p>
		By all means advertise your property on Zillow. After all, it's free. But be aware of the challenges
		you're likely to encounter as both a buyer and seller of FSBO properties. This is not surprising given
		<u>agents are Zillow's primary customer</u>. Instead, buyers and sellers are being used either for the
		listing information they contribute to the market, or for the traffic they generate through search.
	</p>
	<p><em><u>This is the cost of "free".</u></em></p>
