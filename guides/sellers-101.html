<h2>Introduction – The Rollercoaster</h2>

<p>

	</span>
	Selling your property can at best be described as a rollercoaster – full of ups and downs. Success means coming to
	grips with the fear and elation associated with the process, but the end result can be quite rewarding. While most
	people wouldn’t characterize selling their homes as “fun”, our goal is to at very least make the process manageable
	while at the same time preserving as much of your equity as possible. While our goal to provide you the tools to
	walk you through the process from beginning to end, there are many aspects under your direct control which can
	significantly improve your chances of success.
</p>

<p>Regardless of whether or not you’re in a hot market, getting the most for your home requires understanding what
	buyers are looking for and getting their interest. While buyers in hot markets are more willing to tolerate
	imperfections, the principles below apply regardless of the market conditions (which is good for the rest of us).

<h3>Advertising vs. Marketing</h3>

<p>To successfully sell your property requires understanding the difference between advertising and marketing. Most
	people (agents included) confuse advertising for marketing and vice versa.
</p>

<blockquote>The goal of <u>advertising</u> is to get the buyers <u>attention</u>.</blockquote>

<p>The following are forms of advertising:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>Listing your property on MLS or aggregator sites like Zillow</p></li>
	<li><p>Putting up a yard sign</p></li>
	<li><p>Holding an open house</p></li>
	<li><p>Listing your property on an agent’s/broker’s web site</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
	These methods provide awareness to potential homebuyers that your property is for sale, but do not directly address
	questions of appeal and what is unique to your property.
</p>

<blockquote>The goal of <u>marketing</u> is to understand what makes your home <u>desirable</u> to a buyer.</blockquote>

<p>
	Understanding the difference between marketing and advertising is the key to successfully selling your property.
	Excellent realtors understand that the value that they provide is their expertise in marketing.
</p>

<p>
	<em><u>Thankfully, this is something you can learn for yourself.</u></em>

<h3>Marketing – What Makes Your Home Standout?</h3>

<p>
	In markets where supply is severely limited, selling
	<a href="http://www.ktvu.com/news/burned-out-home-in-silicon-valley-selling-for-800k">a lot with a burnt out house
	might still result in a massive payout</a>. For everyone else, this requires identifying all the things which appeal
	to potential buyers. Here are a few of the things that buyers look for when considering location:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		<p>According to realtor.com 78% of homebuyers with school aged children would choose a home in a good school
			district over a home with better amenities (such as a large yard or updated kitchen).</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>If you’re targeting millennials, the character of the neighborhood is a paramount consideration. In a recent
			survey conducted by Ally Home, 91% of the surveyed demographic would consider moving to a different
			community with this quality. This means emphasizing accessibility, mobility, and nearby restaurants/coffee
			shops.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Have a waterfront property? These generally sell for a premium regardless of location according to Zillow.
			However, there is a diminishing demand for these types of properties as measured by the decreasing premium
			paid. This trend may be a result of climate change related concerns by buyers and the perceived risk in
			properties which may be damaged due to extreme weather events.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Zillow's recent analysis of home sales found a number of features which can potentially increase curb appeal and
	directly affect the selling price. These include:</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>Homes with front doors painted black or charcoal grey can command premiums of <strong><u>$6000+.</u></strong>
		</p></li>
	<li><p>Tuxedo kitchens add about <strong><u>$1500</u></strong> to the selling price.</p></li>
	<li><p>Bathrooms and living rooms in neutral blueish tones added <strong><u>$2700</u></strong> to the selling price.
		</p></li>
	<li><p>Does your home have central air conditioning? If so, this could potentially be an additional
		<strong><u>$5000.</u></strong></p></li>
</ul>

<p><em><u>Identifying and showcasing the aspects of your property which make it stand out is core to our listing
	process.</u></em></p>
<hr>

<h3>Pricing – An Educated Guess</h3>

<p>
	Over-estimating the price is a sure way to communicate unrealistic expectations to potential buyers. Listing
	prices, as a rule, can only be adjusted downwards. On the other hand, starting with a lower price may useful to
	generate initial interest, but unless there is a bidding war, you may also be undervaluing your property.
</p>

<p>
	Which begs the question – <em>how do you determine the right price to begin with?</em>
</p>

<blockquote>The key to pricing is <u>research</u> and <u>awareness</u>.</blockquote>

<p>
	Properties recently sold in your area give you a solid basis to compare against your property to determine the
	initial price. Unfortunately, MLS data is generally not available directly to the public, but sites such as Zillow
	can provide this information.
</p>

<p><em>What you’ll come to quickly realize is that pricing is a guessing game.</em></p>

<p>
	While systems such as Zestimates™ can provide a ballpark value, there are numerous cases of it being too low or
	too high. Zillow itself recommends a combination of comparative market assessments, professional appraisals,
	and in person visits to the property to supplement is calculated estimate. In addition, Zestimates are adjusted
	to reflect actual listing prices which makes you question the accuracy of their predictions to begin with.
</p>

<p>
	An educated guess on the initial price is the best you can achieve. This is no different than what agents/brokers
	do. It’s important to understand that the listing price is the starting point for negotiations, not an end in and of
	itself.
</p>

<p><em><u>Be prepared to adjust as needed.</u></em></p>
<hr>

<h3>Showing – Put You Best Foot Forward</h3>

<p>
	Selling is all about first impressions. There are a number of things that you can do to improve these impressions,
	but a lot of it comes down to being prepared before showing your property.
</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		<p><strong>Repair any obvious damage which might affect the price.</strong></p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p><strong>Apply fresh coat of paint.</strong> This goes double for rooms painted red, brown, or yellow as rooms in these colours
			can also reduce the price.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p><strong>Consider hiring a professional stager/photographer for your listing.</strong> They can help you declutter and make your
			home presentation worthy without the emotional baggage.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p><strong>Clean everything (carpets, windows, yard, garage, HVAC, etc.).</strong></p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p><strong>Deodorize the “lived in” smell</strong>. Use lemons, fresh flowers, and baking soda to neutralize
			bad smells. Avoid using artificial deodorants as these have a tendency to only mask the smell.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p><strong>Make the entrance memorable and inviting.</strong></p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>
	<em><u>You can do all these things yourself without having to use an agent. Our in-app checklists can be used to ensure
		that you haven’t overlooked any important details.</u></em>
</p>
<hr>

<h3>Negotiating – Keeping a Level Head</h3>

<p>
	The best negotiators are empathetic, meaning that they can see another person’s perspective. That does not mean
	that they are emotional. While negotiation can be seen as a “winner-take-all” challenge, it is more productive to
	approach it as reaching a beneficial consensus where both parties win by getting what’s important to them. This is
	especially true for a successful real estate transaction.
</p>

<p>Successful negotiations require:</p>

<ol>
	<li><p><strong>Listening.</strong> Without listening, you can’t know what’s important to the homebuyer.</p></li>
	<li>
		<p><strong>Understanding what you consider non-negotiable and communicating that clearly.</strong> This also
			means being prepared to walk away.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p><strong>Addressing the other homebuyer’s concerns.</strong> This may require both sides to reciprocate with
			something negotiable.</p>
	</li>
	<li><p><strong>Being patient.</strong> Rushing to a conclusion is not the goal; a mutually beneficial outcome
		is.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>Remembering to be empathetic, but not emotional.</strong> Don’t take it personally.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Closing – The Homestretch</h3>

<p>Once you’ve successfully negotiated with a homebuyer, there are a few more costs to consider:</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		<p>Closing costs. If you use a traditional realtor, 5-8% of agent’s commission fees from the final price. Half of
			this commission goes to the buyer’s agent, the other half to the seller’s agent.</p>

		<blockquote>
			You can save this amount by subscribing to our application for the duration of your real estate
			transaction.
		</blockquote>

	</li>
	<li>
		<p>If you have a mortgage, then there maybe costs associated with prepayment penalties or home equity loans/lines
		of credit.</p>
	</li>
	<li><p>Title transfer taxes as dictated by your local government.</p></li>
	<li><p>Title insurance fees.</p></li>
	<li><p>Attorney fees.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Keep in mind that these costs will be incurred out of pocket or be deducted from the final
	sale price. Also note that while an agent may assist you with these tasks, a lot depends directly on you.
</p>

<p><em><u>Closing requires coordination. We can help by providing checklists for critical closing tasks.</u></em></p>

<h3>Our Value to You - A New Perspective</h3>
<p>
	The real estate industry as a whole focuses incorrectly on buyers and agents as the primary customer. They fail
	to realize that in an era of chronic housing shortages, it's the seller who should receive the focus. After all,
	you pay the commissions and bear the investment risk. As a seller, you need to ask yourself the question - what
	is the value of using an agent? Given how much of the selling process is directly dependent on you, do you really
	need one?
</p>
<p>
	According to NAR's 2017 statistics, 8% of all listings were sold for sale by owner. In the past, this number was
	as high as 20% of the total volume. What changed? In the same period, agent lead listings have increased from 69%
	to 87%. Limiting direct access to MLS data by consumers (which NAR officially supports) only helps agents maintain
	control for their own benefit. Despite the commoditization of search by technology, the real estate industry as
	a whole has not updated their costs to reflect the diminishing value of their services.
</p>
<p>
	Not everyone will be comfortable navigating the selling process by themselves. That's OK. The expertise and
	emotional support is the price of commission charged by agents. For others, they understand that their home is
	one of their most valuable posessions and that giving away a significant amount of their wealth should be considered
	cautiously. Finding a way to preserve as much of that wealth makes good financial sense. We can help.
