excerpt: |
  Discussions about agent commissions invariably revolve around the cost of providing their
  services and expertise to both buyers and sellers. While it is up to the customer to
  determine whether or not the service they provide is worth it, there are a few perspectives
  which should also be considered.

<a name="dilution"><h2>The Dilution of Equity</h2></a>

<p>
    Something that is rarely discussed is the impact of commission on homeowner equity. When commission is calculated,
    it is done so against the purchase price of the property - <em><u>not against the homeowner's equity</u></em>.
    In a traditional real estate transaction, this works out to approximately 5-8% with the commission divided equally
    between the buyer ‘s and the seller’s agents. While this transactional cost is portrayed as marginal, it
    represents a significant portion of a homeowner's wealth. For most people, their largest financial asset is
    their home.
</p>
<p>We can think of equity in these terms:</p>
<blockquote>

    <strong>EQUITY</strong> = [ <u>Deposit</u> + <u>Principal Payments</u> + <u>Increase in Property Value</u> ] -
    [ <u>Commission of Purchase Price</u> ]

</blockquote>
<p>
    To begin, let's imagine purchasing a home for $500k<sup>*</sup> with a 20% deposit<sup>**</sup> ($100k).
    A few years later, you are able to sell the property for $750k. Also assume that between when your purchased
    your home and when it you finally sold it, you were able to pay down the mortgage an additional $50k. Given
    commission rates of 5-8% of the <em><u>purchase price</u></em>, how much of your equity is diluted with
    this transactional cost?
<div>
    <sub>
        * $500k is the average price of a home in Canada.In the US, it is $188k, but this does not account for the
        regional variations where high demand jobs significantly inflate home prices in the largest metropolitan cities.
    </sub>
</div>
<div>
    <sub>
        ** A 20% deposit means no additional mortgage insurance costs in both Canada and the US. Otherwise, this cost
        would reduce the amount of principal paid.

    <strong>In this example, agent commissions work out to almost double the percentage of dilution!</strong> While
    the numbers are representative, they are ideal in that the purchase price is well below the average in competitive
    markets such as Seattle and San Francisco. Also, a 20% deposit is a luxury that few can afford. The majority of
    people will require mortgage insurance with deposits below the 20% threshold. Together, these conditions
    would reduce the amount of accumulated equity. <em><u>Dilution would be even higher in these cases.</u></em>
</p>
<p>
    According to Attom Data Solutions, 66% of all homeowners have a mortgage. This means the majority will experience
    dilution of their equity when the sell their homes through an agent or broker. Homeowners who have no mortgage
    experience the least amount of dilution, but still incur the full cost of the agent's total commission (which could
    still be significant).
</p>

<p><em><u>Why not save that money?</u></em></p>

<a name="premium"><h2>The Commission Premium on Mortgages</h2></a>

<p>
    Only 1/3 of all home owners are equity rich (meaning they have no mortgage). These owners have the upper hand
    as they can position themselves as all cash buyers or assume smaller mortgages if they decide to scale up. This
    means significantly less dilution of their equity when they sell their property and more affordable mortgages.
</p>
<p>
    The majority of homeowners however, are equity poor. Buyers who will be assuming mortgages should be aiming to
    minimize the purchase price as it moves them closer to a mortgage free future.
</p>
<p>
    Let's again begin with a few assumptions:
    <ol>
        <li>You've purchase a $500k home with a 20% deposit (which works out to $100k). This means a $400k mortgage.</li>
        <li>Using an agent, you've paid an extra 2.5% - 4% premium on the purchase price.</li>
        <li>You do not move, pay the mortgage to its completion and take a fixed rate mortgage of 3.5%<sup>*</sup>
            amortized over 25 years.</li>
    </ol>
<div>
    <sub>
        * We choose the rate and term as our basis for comparison. These numbers are used for illustrative purposes
        as these values can vary dramatically depending on your situation. Also note that mortgage rates are at
        historical lows. Should rates rise, the cost of borrowing will be even more expensive.

    If leveraged smartly, the agent's commission could literally shave years off your mortgage. Paying off your
    mortgage quickly also saves additional interest payments.
